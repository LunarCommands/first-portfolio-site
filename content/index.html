From C++, by PHP, HTML, CSS and JavaScript, ending with the Python. I fall in love with Django once and we are still meeting sometimes. I love programming and learning new stuff all the time. I currently learn Go.</p></div></div><div class="bg-grey rounded-lg border border-gray-500 shadow-xl m-8"><div class="px-8 py-8"><img src="assets/program.png" alt="program" class="mb-3 w-24 h-24 mx-auto"><h2 class="text-primary-300 text-center text-2xl mb-5">Automation</h2><p class="text-primary-100 text-lg">It is linked to programming but I want to give a much closer look what I am truly doing. I&#39;ve chosen Python as my main language because of it&#39;s beauty. I pay a lot attention to code to look as beautiful as it can. Automation is the thing that Python handles very well where comes to find a quick solution to a problem that just appeared. Once I had a problem to download all of my favourite music from my YouTube playlist so I wrote few lines of code and it worked. You can find all my projects on my GitHub account.</p></div></div><div class="bg-grey rounded-lg border border-gray-500 shadow-xl m-8"><div class="px-8 py-8"><img src="assets/hacker.png" alt="hacker" class="mb-3 w-24 h-24 mx-auto"><h2 class="text-primary-300 text-center text-2xl mb-5">Cybersecurity</h2><p class="text-primary-100 text-lg">The fact that I like to solve problems should not surprise anyone anymore. Since I was a little kid I loved everything related to hacking. Someday I came across the site with CTF&#39;s and it got me hooked to this day. From CTF&#39;s, by hacking my way in to the hackthebox site, ending with pentesting. All legal of course 😉.</p></div></div><!--]--></div></div><div class="md:w-3/6"><h1 class="text-primary-100 text-center text-5xl">My hobbys</h1><div><!--[--><div class="bg-grey rounded-lg border border-gray-500 shadow-xl m-8"><div class="px-8 py-8"><img src="assets/vinyl.png" alt="vinyl" class="mb-3 w-24 h-24 mx-auto"><h2 class="text-primary-300 text-center text-2xl mb-5">Music Production</h2><p class="text-primary-100 text-lg">Since I was a little kid I&#39;ve always loved electronic music. Well, I think I love everything related to computers 😜. I started my music journey listening to the very famous group - The Prodigy whose still big inspiration for me. I got through many electronic genres from Drum and Bass to Techno. The part of me that is responsible for creativity has spoken and I have started making music. It is inseparable part of me which I satisfy in my free time.</p></div></div><div class="bg-grey rounded-lg border border-gray-500 shadow-xl m-8"><div class="px-8 py-8"><img src="assets/dj.png" alt="dj" class="mb-3 w-24 h-24 mx-auto"><h2 class="text-primary-300 text-center text-2xl mb-5">DJ</h2><p class="text-primary-100 text-lg">My father got two turntables and a lot of vinyl records, so I have decided to try myself in DJing. After a couple of weeks I was invited by my friends to a party in a club. They wanted me to play warmup. I borrowed some techno vinyls from my father&#39;s collection and came to the club as Phil Elementz. Since then I am building successively my career as a Dj. I record podcasts, vinyl sets and play in clubs.</p></div></div><div class="bg-grey rounded-lg border border-gray-500 shadow-xl m-8"><div class="px-8 py-8"><img src="assets/basketball.png" alt="basketball" class="mb-3 w-24 h-24 mx-auto"><h2 class="text-primary-300 text-center text-2xl mb-5">Basketball</h2><p class="text-primary-100 text-lg">I played basketball for the team from my city for 4 years. I had to quit because of my knee injury. I wanted to go back to my favourite sport as quick as possible, but when it happened I was already too old for playing in my city&#39;s team. To this day I am playing with my friends on the courts or rented halls and waching my favourite team (Dallas Mavericks) playing and I am sure that I will never quit.</p></div></div><!--]--></div></div></div></div><!--[--><div class="bg-primary-100 text-5xl rounded-tl-3xl rounded-tr-3xl h-50 flex flex-wrap pt-20 justify-center"><div class="hover:text-primary-300 m-12 shadow-"><a href="https://github.com/LunarCommands" target="blank">GitHub</a></div><div class="hover:text-primary-300 m-12 shadow-"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/filip-wolski-b798b9210/" target="blank">LinkedIn</a></div><div class="hover:text-primary-300 m-12"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/PhilipElementz" target="blank">Facebook</a></div><div class="hover:text-primary-300 m-12 shadow-"><a href="https://soundcloud.com/phil_elementz" target="blank">Soundcloud</a></div></div><p class="bg-primary-100 pt-20 text-xl text-center">©Lunar Commands</p><!--]--></div></div><script>window.__NUXT__={data:{},state:{error:null},_errors:{},serverRendered:true,config:{public:{},app:{baseURL:"\u002F",buildAssetsDir:"\u002F_nuxt\u002F",cdnURL:""}}}</script><script type="module" src="entry-2b94ace1.mjs" crossorigin></script>
