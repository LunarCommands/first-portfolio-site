I pay a lot attention to code to look as beautiful as it can. Automation is the thing that Python handles very well where comes to find a quick solution to a problem that just appeared. Once I had a problem to download all of my favourite music from my YouTube playlist so I wrote few lines of code and it worked. You can find all my projects on my GitHub account.",
